# Heart Of Generation Website

## Overview

Welcome to the Heart Of Generation website, the online presence of our community-based organization. Heart Of Generation is dedicated to serving the needy and underprivileged families through various initiatives. Our mission is to provide assistance in the form of food, training, scholarships, and more. We operate multiple ministries to address both the physical and spiritual needs of those living in desperate poverty in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya.

## About Us

### Our Mission

Heart Of Generation is a non-denominational mission agency founded with the purpose of bringing love and hope to unreached people in impoverished regions of the world.

### What We Do

- **Food Assistance:** We provide food to the needy and hungry.
- **Training:** We offer training programs to help people acquire valuable skills.
- **Scholarships:** We support education through scholarships.

### Our Priorities

At Heart Of Generation, we aim to "Flesh Out" the passion of Christ before a lost and dying world. Our focus is on those whom the world might consider as "the least." We prioritize investing our greatest resources and energies in helping those in need because we believe that every act of kindness to the least is an act of service to Jesus.

> "I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me." â€” Jesus (Matthew 25:40)
